# Beginners JavaScript Workshop

## What is this?

This is an introductory workshop to JavaScript. You'll be learning the fundamentals of JavaScript, and completing some mini-challenges along the way.

## Why JavaScript?

If you want to learn to code, JavaScript is a great first language. As the official language of the web, you can build amazing websites and applications with JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS. It's easy to use, and has immediate payoff. Once you learn JavaScript, you'll find it easier to learn other programming languages which share common concepts.

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is divided into a number of steps. In each step, you will be introduced to a new programming concept, be shown some examples, and be given a challenge to complete. At the end of each step, you should find a link to continue onto the next step.

## Before You Start

###### 1. Install a developer-friendly browser

You will need either Google Chrome or Firefox for this workshop (preferably Chrome). These browsers have the best tools for coding, and include something called the "developer console" which will allow you to see your code working.

###### 2. Install a code editor

You will need a code editor, which allows you to write code locally on your computer. We recommend Atom or Sublime Text.
