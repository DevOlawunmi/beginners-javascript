# Step 4: Variables

## Try it out

```js
var name = 'BeyoncÃ©';

console.log(name);
```

### Mini challenge

Log the `typeof` for three different values, like you did in Step 2: `"node girls"`, `1234` and `false`. But this time, instead of writing them inside the `console.log()`, define them as variables at the top of the file and put the variable name instead.
