# Step 1: Hello World

It is programming tradition that the first thing you do in any language is make it say "Hello world!". This is the first thing we'll do in JavaScript, using something called a `console.log()`.

## `console.log()`

We want to print "Hello world!" to the console: a place where you can see the output of your code. Thankfully in JavaScript there is a built-in way to do this, using a `console.log()`. You just need to put any text inside quotes, inside the parentheses, and when you run the code you should see that text printed to the console.

### Try it out

Write this in your `script.js` file:

```js
console.log('Hello world!');
```

Refresh your HTML file in the browser, check the console, and you should see "Hello world!" printed out. It'll look something like this:

### Mini challenge

Try to `console.log()` something different. Try to `console.log()` several things at once. What happens when you get rid of the quote marks? What happens when you `console.log()` just a number without quotes?
